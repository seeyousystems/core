/*
 *  Controller.h
 *
 *  The Controller module is responsible for safely controlling and maneuvering
 *  the hardware. It sends the control commands to COIL which in turn translates
 *  and transmits the commands over the serial interface. The Controller module
 *  is also responsible for receiving sensory data and providing it to other
 *  modules within the emss Core, such as the Tracker module and various Maps.
 *  The Controller class inherits from CoreThread and runs in its own thread.
 *  Implementations of the Controller class must implement the methods process()
 *  and setWheelSpeed(ï¿½). The method emergencyStop() must be implemented to
 *  handle an emergency stop in further detail.
