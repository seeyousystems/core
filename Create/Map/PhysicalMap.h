/*
 *  PhysicalMap.h
 *
 *
 *  The emss Physical map represents the real world environment in its physical
 *  state. This Map is currently used for simulation purposes, but in the
 *  future can also be used for various Tasks which would like to combine
 *  a predefined perception of the environment. The Physical Map offers the
 *  method getAreaType(x,y) which returns either Open Area or Collision
 *  Area ï¿½ just like the Heat Map. The Emulated Emss Controller uses this
 *  Map to emulate the IR Range Finder during simulations, something which
 *  has proven especially useful as the robots environment can now be almost
 *  entirely emulated. To define the areas of a physical map, all one has to
 *  do is draw a RGBA image, such as a 24-bit PNG, and let the Physical Map
 *  load the file. Any area in the image which has the alpha channel not at
 *  255 (full) is regarded as Open Area.
