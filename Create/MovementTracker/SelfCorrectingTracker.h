/*
 *  SelfCorrectingTracker.h
 *
 *  The SelfCorrectingTracker is an advanced Tracker which inherits from
 *  SingleTracker. This Tracker doesnï¿½t change anything the SingleTracker
 *  does, but extends its functionality to be able to make corrections when
 *  deemed applicable. To do this, the SelfCorrectingTracker makes use of
 *  the currently loaded PhysicalMap to map correlations and determine if
 *  the overall localization has peered off in error. If such an error is
 *  determined, it is accordingly corrected by adjusting all the MovementTrackers
 *  positions. This Tracker looks to be promising for future work related to
 *  improving the quality, or accuracy, of the robot localization, and is
 *  described in larger detail than the other Trackers.
