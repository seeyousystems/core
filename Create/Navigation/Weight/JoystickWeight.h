 *  The JoystickWeight binds the signals from a Joystick widgets into the channel.
 *  When the joystickï¿½s yokes are idle (zero), the JoystickWeight will have no
 *  influence. However, when the yokes are active the Weight will alter the
 *  wheel speeds to correspond to the movement of the joystick.
