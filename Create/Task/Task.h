/*
 *  Task.h
 *
 *  Core Tasks bind all the components of the emss framework together, enabling
 *  the robot to perform actions in its environment. As already mentioned,
 *  the Task Manager is responsible for executing the Tasks one by one.
 *  Each emss Task must inherit from the class Task and implement the method
 *  process(). When a Task is created, its initial status is Waiting. When
 *  the Task Manager decides to schedule the Task for execution, its status
 *  is set to Running. The process() method of the Task is called by the Task
 *  Manager at its given interval (each Task can define its own interval)
 *  until the task sets its status as Finished.
