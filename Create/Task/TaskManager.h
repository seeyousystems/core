/*
 *  TaskManager.h
 *
 *  The Task Manager is a separate thread which contains a Task List. The
 *  Task List is nothing more than a helper class for sequentially storing
 *  and retrieving Tasks, offering useful functions such as getNextSpecificTask(type).
 *  As soon as the Task Manager receives a Task, appends it to the Task List and
 *  starts to execute it. If the Task Manager receives more than one Task at a
 *  time, it appends it to the back of the Task List, where in time will eventually
 *  be executed. The Task Manager also allows Tasks to be interrupted. In this case
 *  the manager will set the current Task as Interrupted and go to the next Task in
 *  the list.
