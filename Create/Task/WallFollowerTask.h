 *  WallFollowerTask.h
 *
 *  The boundary of a room is best found by following its wall ï¿½ if the room
 *  is closed, at least. To allow the robot to follow walls and investigate
 *  the structure of the room the WallFollowerTask has been implemented.
 *  This Task initializes the SystemOfWeightsNavigation weight-channel best
 *  suited to follow walls.
